Narrator:  Ancient Bihar, known as Magadha, was the seat of powerful empires and a beacon of knowledge.  This fertile land witnessed the rise of Buddhism, with Siddhartha Gautama achieving enlightenment under the Bodhi tree, and Jainism, founded by Mahavira. The Mauryan Empire, under Emperor Ashoka, unified much of the Indian subcontinent, leaving a legacy of peace and dharma.  The subsequent Gupta Empire ushered in a golden age of art, science, and literature, further enriching Bihar's cultural heritage.  Beyond the imperial centers, the regions of Mithila and Bhojpur flourished, developing unique artistic and literary traditions that contributed to the rich tapestry of ancient Indian culture.

This period saw the rise of indigo plantations and the exploitation of local resources, leading to widespread agrarian unrest.
